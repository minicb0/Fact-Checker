# Fact-Checker
## Inspiration
Fake news has existed since the dawn of the printing press but in the age of internet and
social media, it has found a tremendous application. Manipulation of algorithms of social
media and search enginesâ€”to reach large audiences and mislead news consumers is a
global trend now. `Fact-Checker` is an attempt to minimize the fake news that enters social media.

## What it does
`Fact-Checker` is an end-to-end client-sever application that acts as a platform between journalist students and people who want to get their news checked before posting on social media platforms.
It provides different functionalities to both parties. for general people : 
- Ability to create news information that requires verification.
- View the feedback and credibility rating provided by the journalist students.

for the journalist students:
- See active news information and join any project.
- Rate and comment on any news info.
- See the number of people are working on a news project.

- MongoDB (database)
- mongoose (odm)
